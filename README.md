# Honeycomb-Structure-Parametric-Analysis
This is an on-going supervised project in which I have to do the parametric analysis of the honeycomb structure through FEA using the
concepts of design of experiments, response surface, regression analysis, and optimization. I have to design a base model of the honeycomb
structure and simulate it to determine the behavior of mechanical parameters. Then, for the parametric analysis, the range of values
will be given to the dimensional parameters of honeycomb such as length, height, thickness, and corner radius of a unit cell. Finally, the 
optimized value of all these parameters will be determined such that the structure has the minimum deflection and stresses under the 
compression loading.
