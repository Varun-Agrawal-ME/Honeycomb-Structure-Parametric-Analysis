# Honeycomb-Unit-Cell-Optimization-Parametric-Analysis
Supervised Project (Advisor - Dr. Dhruv Bhate)
• Designed hexagon HC cell in SpaceClaim by recording python script; Parametrized inner radius, thickness, and corner radius 
• Implemented periodic boundary conditions on an RVE for isotropic material in ANSYS; Performed mesh size and cell depth analysis; Formulated its in-plane effective Young’s modulus to assess von-Mises stress; Employed full-factorial design with 64 points and plotted response surfaces & local sensitivity curves by using 16 verification points to identify parameters effect  
• Direct Optimization of cell by keeping stress under 15 MPa and downscaled geometry volume by 21.5 % from center values
